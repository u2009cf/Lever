  Many stream processing frameworks have been developed to meet the requirements of real-time processing. Among them, batch stream processing frameworks are widely advocated with the consideration of their fault-tolerance and high throughput. In batch stream processing frameworks , straggler, happened due to the uneven task execution time, has been regarded as a major hurdle of latency-sensitive applications. Existing straggler mitigation techniques, operating in either reactive or proactive manner, are all post-scheduling methods, and therefore may inevitably result in high resource overhead or long job completion time. We notice that batch stream processing jobs are usually recurring with predictable characteristics. By exploring such feature, we present a pre-scheduling straggler mitigation framework called Lever. Lever first identifies potential stragglers and evaluates nodes' capability by analyzing execution information of historical jobs. Then, Lever carefully pre-schedules job input data to each node before task scheduling so as to mitigate the potential stragglers. We implement Lever and contribute it as an extension of Apache Spark Streaming. Our experimental results show that Lever can reduce job completion time by 30.72\% to 42.19\% over Spark Streaming, a widely adopted batch stream processing system and outperforms traditional techniques significantly.
